Main Window
===========

OpenShot Video Editor has one main window which contains most of the information, buttons,
and menus needed to edit your video project.

Overview
--------

   ==  ==================  ============
   1   Main Toolbar        Contains buttons to open, save, and export your video project.
   2   Function Tabs       Switch between Project Files, Transitions, Effects, and Emojis.
   3   Project Files       All audio, video, and image files that have been imported into your project.
   4   Preview Window      This is the area that the video will playback on the screen.
   5   Edit Toolbar        This toolbar contains buttons used for snapping, inserting markers, slicing razor, and jumping between markers.
   6   Zoom Slider         This slider will adjust the time-scale of your timeline. Drag the left or right edge to zoom in or out. Drag the blue area to scroll the timeline left or right. Clips and transitions are displayed as simple rectangles, to give you context for adjusting the zoom to specific clips.
   7   Play-head / Ruler   The ruler shows the time-scale, and the red line is the play-head. The play-head represents the current playback position. Hold `Shift` key while dragging the playhead to snap to nearby clips.
   8   Timeline            The timeline visualizes your video project, and each clip and transition in your project. You can drag the mouse to select, move, or delete multiple items.
   9   Filter              Filter the list of items shown (project files, transitions, effects, and emojis) by using these buttons and filter textbox. Enter a few letters of what you are looking for, and the results will be shown.
   10  Playback            Left to Right: Jump to Start, Rewind, Play/Pause, Fast Forward, and Jump to End

For step-by-step instructions on the basic usage of OpenShot, be sure to read the
:ref:`quick_tutorial_ref`.

Built-in Tutorial
-----------------
When you first launch OpenShot, you will be presented with a friendly built-in tutorial. It will point out and explain
the basics. Clicking **Next** will jump to the next topic. You can always view this tutorial again from the **Help\â†’Tutorial** menu.

.. _tracks_ref:

Tracks & Layers
------------------

OpenShot uses tracks to layer videos and images. The top most track is the top layer, and the bottom track is the bottom layer.
If you are familiar with layers in a photo editing application, then you should be quite familiar with this concept.
OpenShot will mix each layer together, just like a photo editing application. You can have an unlimited number of tracks, but
typically a video project will not need more than 5 tracks.

For example, imagine a 3 track video project

   #   Name                Description
   ==  ==================  ============
   1   Top Track           Clips on this track will always be on top and visible. Often watermarks and titles are placed on higher tracks.
   2   Middle Track        Clips in the middle (might or might not be visible, depending on what is above them)
   3   Bottom Track        Clips on this track will always be on the bottom. Often audio clips are placed on lower tracks.
